# Leonardo Da Vinci landing

A simple landing page generated by GPT from a screenshot of <https://www.raccoons.be/what-we-think/whitepapers/the-generative-ai-playbook>


prompt:

`Create a Nuxt website that looks like the attached screenshot. Use any additional libraries required.`

There's a lot of the original that was not replicated. But its an impressive start from a screenshot. There has been some manual tweaking since the initial generation. Notably, there were some early build issues that I did not document.
